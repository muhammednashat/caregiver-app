قال عالم النفس الألماني «فرانك لوباخ»:
 "مهما بلغ شعورك بوحدة نفسك، فاعلم أنك لست بمفردك أبدًا."

 قد تكون هذه الرسالة أمامك اليوم كي لا تتوقف مهما كان الشعور الذي يسكن بداخلك، الجميع هُنا يشعر بمشاعرك ويسعى للتخلص منها دون خجل.

 (تأكد أن استسلامك للخجل من مشاعر لم تخترها بنفسك هو الذي ستخجل منه في الأصل يومًا ما).

    <string name="description_step_1">
        Family members and friends who provide support to individuals with mental illness often face societal judgments, especially in cultures where mental health issues are misunderstood or not openly discussed, leading to feelings of shame and stigma. This stigma can deeply affect caregivers, causing self-blame and feelings of inadequacy. They may fear being blamed for their loved one’s condition or being socially rejected, which adds to their emotional burden and contributes to isolation. Additionally, this stigma may cause hesitation in seeking the necessary care for those facing mental health challenges.
/nAs the saying goes, “Many are blamed though they bear no fault”, Be kind to yourself, your loved one’s mental struggles are beyond both your control and theirs, and you are doing your best to provide support. Free yourself from guilt and show yourself the same compassion that you offer to others. Remember that societal judgements and stigma often stem from a lack of knowledge and understanding about mental health. Every action you take to support your loved ones reflects your strength and dedication, regardless of whether society fully understands or appreciates it. Understand the importance of your role as a caregiver, and do not let societal perceptions weaken your resolve. Your support is vital and can greatly impact the well-being of your loved ones
</string>

    <string name="to_do_step_1">
Consider journaling your thoughts and feelings. This practice can help you process emotions and release the burden of guilt.</string>

    <string name="description_step_2">
        Understanding mental health benefits both you and your loved ones. The more you know, the stronger and more resilient you become. Replace blame with empowerment through knowledge; as a poet said:
/nKnowledge clears the blindness from the heart of its possessor,/n
 just as the moon brightens the darkness.
</string>

        You don’t have to carry this burden alone. Reach out to those who understand your situation and can provide support, whether through a support group or a trusted friend. The poet expressed:

Helping someone who is suffering from depression is not just a single step; it is a series of thoughtful actions. Every step, no matter how small, is part of the journey towards recovery. Remember, you are part of a support system that can help guide your loved one out of the darkness of depression.
</string>

    <string name="recognizing_signs">Recognize the Signs</string>


    <string name="description_camposs_step_1">The poet said:/n
And sorrow takes a toll on the stout frame, /n/n
while it greys the boy’s forelock and ages him./nDepression can appear like the clouds that precede a storm. You may not notice it at first, but over time, it intensifies and settles in, making it harder for your loved one to see the way forward. While you cannot stop the clouds, recognizing them early allows you to prepare. Understanding the symptoms helps in addressing any situation you face.
</string>

    <string name="step_2_title">Approach with Empathy</string>
    <string name="step_2_desc">
    When interacting with someone suffering from depression, avoid saying things like "Why are you so sad? You should be happy!". Such statements can give the impression that you are judging them, suggesting that what they are experiencing is trivial, even though it is beyond their control. This can make them feel worse or less inclined to open up. Instead of labelling their feelings, express your observations with empathy, such as saying, "I've noticed you seem a bit different lately", and reassure them by saying, "I'm here if you want to talk."/n/n
When they decide to speak, practise active listening. This means giving them your full attention, maintaining eye contact, and responding with affirming gestures or brief verbal cues. Avoid interrupting them or offering immediate solutions; sometimes, they just need someone to listen.
</string>
    <string name="step_2_action">مارس الاستماع النشط وابتعد عن تقديم حلول فورية.</string>
    <string name="step_1_action">
Open gentle conversations about how they feel. Ask kindly: "How are you feeling today? It's okay if things aren't going well. I'm here to listen."</string>

    <string name="step_3_title">Avoid Toxic Positivity</string>
    <string name="step_3_desc">In your efforts to support someone struggling with depression, it\'s essential to recognize the difference between genuine encouragement and toxic positivity. While maintaining a positive outlook is important, it’s crucial to avoid overly simplistic phrases that may inadvertently diminish the reality of the person\'s struggle with depression. Phrases like "Just be happy!" "You have so much to be happy about!" or "You'll be fine; just give it time" may seem supportive, but they can come across as dismissive of their feelings./nInstead, acknowledge their emotions and reassure them that feeling sadness, frustration, or any negative emotions is normal during difficult times. You might say something like, "I know this is hard for you, and it's okay to feel this way". This approach fosters genuine connection, allowing them to express their feelings without pressure.</string>
    <string name="step_3_action">اعترف بمشاعرهم وشجعهم على التعبير عن أنفسهم.</string>
    <string name="step_4_title">Be Their Sanctuary</string>
    <string name="step_4_desc">Imagine your loved one as a tree in the midst of a storm filled with negative thoughts and emotions. They don’t need additional storms in your interaction with them; instead, dedicate time for calm companionship. There’s no need to offer solutions—just be present. As the poet said:/n/nO healer of the soul, you are its physician,/n/n
 So be gentle with a soul that has been neglected by its beloved.
</string>
    <string name="step_4_action">اقض وقتًا هادئًا معهم دون ضغط.</string>
    <string name="step_5_title">Encourage Them to Seek Professional Help</string>
    <string name="step_5_desc">Sometimes, the negative thoughts and emotions your loved one is experiencing can feel overwhelmingly heavy. Even if you try to console them, you cannot guide them on your own. This is where they need professional help. Gently suggest that they reach out to a doctor or counsellor for assistance, without applying pressure. You might say, "I think talking to a doctor could help you find some peace."
</string>
    <string name="step_5_action">Offer to assist them in searching for doctors or accompany them to their first appointment.</string>

    <string name="step_6_title">Be Patient and Present</string>
    <string name="step_6_desc">Recovering from depression is a gradual process, and it’s important to be patient. There will be good days and bad days. Continue to support them, even if you feel that your efforts are not yielding immediate results./n/n
Think of it like planting seeds. At first, growth may not be visible. But with consistent care, the roots grow deeper, and eventually, the tree flourishes</string>
    <string name="step_6_action">استمر في دعمه حتى لو لم تظهر النتائج فورًا.</string>

    <string name="step_7_title">Recognize the Darkest Clouds</string>

    <string name="step_7_desc">Sometimes, the journey takes a dangerous turn. Depression can lead to thoughts of self-harm or suicide, making vigilance even more crucial. Recognize the warning signs, such as withdrawal from others or talking about death\n\nDon’t be afraid to ask, "Are you thinking of harming yourself?". It’s a difficult question, but it could save a life. If the answer is yes, take immediate action by contacting a professional or emergency services. Your love and quick response can pull them out of that dark moment</string>

    <string name="step_7_action">ابحث عن علامات التحذير واتخذ إجراءات سريعة إذا لزم الأمر.</string>

    <string name="step_8_title">Offer Practical Support</string>
    <string name="step_8_desc">Depression can make simple tasks feel overwhelming. Quietly step in to help your loved one with small tasks. Maybe cook a meal or assist with some household chores.
        These small acts of help can lighten their load and give them space to focus on their mental health. As a poet said:\nWho is the healer for my ailments and pains,\n
 or the companion to share my worries?\n
I was once resilient, but certain trials,\n
 have blended my strength with deep sorrow.\n
Oh, my friend, when fate sought to diminish me,\n
it found a heart still steadfast, unshaken by fear.\n
Go ahead now and ask my heart about its turmoil,\n
 for within it lies all manner of sickness and grief.\n
Even the most eloquent tongue,\n
cannot fully express the anguish between my ribs\n</string>
    <string name="step_8_action">قدم المساعدة في المهام البسيطة لتخفيف العبء عنهم.</string>

    <string name="step_9_title">Offer Light in Small Doses</string>
    <string name="step_9_desc">Depression is like being trapped in a dark room. You can’t push them into the light, but you can open a window and let a small ray of light through. Encourage them to take small steps to engage in activities or do something they used to enjoy, even if only for short periods, like taking a walk or watching a favourite movie.
</string>
    <string name="step_9_action">Start with simple, achievable activities. Avoid overwhelming them with too much at once, and do celebrate the small victories along the way</string>
